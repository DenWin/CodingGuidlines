# Agent Manifest

## Project Context
- Repository: <name>
- Domain: <business area>
- Primary language(s): <language list>
- Critical constraints: <compliance/performance/etc>

## Workflow Expectations
1. Read every policy listed below before executing tasks.
2. Cite rule identifiers (e.g. `BASE-001`) when making decisions informed by these policies.
3. Escalate when guidance is missing, ambiguous, or conflicts with real-world constraints.

## Policy File Format
Policies in this repository follow a common schema:
```yaml
version: 0.0.1
rules:
  - id: <DOMAIN>-<NNN>
    level: MUST|MUST NOT|REQUIRED|SHALL|SHALL NOT|SHOULD|SHOULD NOT|RECOMMENDED|MAY|OPTIONAL
    text: "<Short imperative rule>"
```
Keep rationale out of the YAML to save prompt tokens; document reasoning in the READMEs instead.

## Relevant Policies

## TODO Intake
Adopt `common/ai-todo-intake.md` before selecting work:
- Parse `ToDo.md` for backlog entries by scanning `### ID: <ID>` headings and the associated fields (`**Title:**`, `**Description:**`, `**Acceptance Criteria:**`, `**Priority:**`, `**Status:**`, `**Notes:**`).
- Treat statuses `Open`, `In Progress`, and `Blocked` as actionable; skip entries marked `Done` unless a reviewer states otherwise.
- Present actionable IDs with their titles (and priority when present) and ask which to execute using the `fix <ID> [<ID> ...]` command pattern (example: `fix T-002 T-005`).
- Pause if the user declines to choose, record the deferral, and escalate when `ToDo.md` is absent or malformed.
- Log the intake timestamp, the parsed file path, and the selected IDs before doing any implementation work.

## Reporting
Document open questions, policy gaps, and assumptions alongside deliverables so maintainers can strengthen the shared guidelines without inflating future prompts.
